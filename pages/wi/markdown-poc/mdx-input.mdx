### Using MDXjs from an MDX file.
MDX is a JSX in Markdown loader, parser, and renderer for ambitious projects.

##### note: event date is loaded as a prop sent from parent mdx-text.js file through JSX fragment syntax. works by itself because it renders through HTML
<span>{props.eventDate}</span> 

##### note: dates are loaded from another JS/config file. works because HTML is wrapping section
<div>The event date is {variables.eventDate} and the call for speakers is {variables.callForSpeakersDate}!</div> 

##### note: fails to render variable or prop because it evals as MD only
The event date is <span>{variables.eventDate}</span>!
